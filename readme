The project was done sequentially - all changes from question 1 should carry over to question 2 etc...
The book doesnt really say to start over with 3.1 for each question so that is how I did the exercises.
I will extract each program from version control and name it main1.c for question1, main2.c for question 2, etc...
Likewise executables my_prog1 is for question 1, my_prog2 is for question 2...
